I have developed this assignment in Jupyter Notebook. The programming language I have used is Python. In this we have used some open-source python libraries like numpy which shows the array elements reshaped and some operations in numpy. Next we have pandas library which takes the csv file and converts it into dataframe which shows rows and columns format and peforms all the operations like describe(), mean() and scatter for graphical representation of two columns etc. Finally, matplotlib which represent the pie chart.
